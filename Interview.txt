Q.1) 
// what will be output of below code?
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
//it is in the function.
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);

// when user will click to button value increase by 1 not with 3.
counter = 16

Because:
         -It's a react foundational concept.
         -React doesn't immediately update the state.
         -useSate kya karta hen jitane bhi update UI me bhejna hen to vo batches me bhejta hen.
         -kyu ki ham yaha akhi kam same tarah se kar rahen hen.
         -here it will become a batch and see work is doing same.
         -then it will sent this updation to the UI.
         -that's reason it only will increase 1 because it in batch.
         -Instead, it schedules an update and batches multiple state updates into a single update for performance reasons.
